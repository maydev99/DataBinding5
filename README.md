Super Simple Data Binding Example for Kotlin (Android) designed for 2021
I was having trouble wrapping my head around Data Binding. 
Many tutorials I read were out date or carried a bunch of extra code that took 
away from nbeing able to understand DataBinding.

Eventually I figured it out made this simple app to show how it works.
Hope this helps other developers starting to leard Data Binding.
