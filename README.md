Super Simple Data Binding Example for Kotlin (Android) designed for 2021

I was having trouble wrapping my head around Data Binding. 
Many of tutorials I read were out date or carried a bunch of extra code that took 
away from being able to understand DataBinding.

Eventually, I figured it out and made this simple app to show how it works.
Hope this helps other developers who are starting to learn Data Binding.
